As the world becomes increasingly dependent on electronic devices, the amount of electronic waste (e-waste) generated is growing at an alarming rate. Out of a total of 2 million tons of electronic waste recorded by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry in 2021. In fact, only around 17.4% have been managed properly. The rest is still stored at home or goes into landfills and mixed with other types of waste. Disposal of e-waste in landfills poses a serious threat to the environment and human health due to the presence of toxic substances such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. Recycling e-waste is crucial for reducing the environmental impact and conserving valuable resources. However, the lack of awareness and easy access to e-waste recycling services remains a significant challenge. In this context, there is a need for a user-friendly and efficient e-waste recycling application that can connect users with nearby recycling facilities and provide information on the proper disposal and handling of e-waste. 🍀
